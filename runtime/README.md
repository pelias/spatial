# Runtime Environment

This repo has several run-time dependencies on statically-linked libraries.

Package managers on various operating systems/platforms provide inconsistent versions of these dependencies, this makes it difficult to install the correct versions in `/usr/local` without breaking other software on the system.

In order to overcome this problem we instead install the dependencies outside of the main operating system dir `/usr/local`, instead compiling and installing the dependencies in a  directory of our choosing.

By default the runtime directory is configured as `/opt/spatial`, it is strongly recommended you use this location as everything 'just works'.

Note: on many operating systems `/opt` will be owned by root, so if you manually `sudo mkdir -p /opt/spatial` and `sudo chown $USER /opt/spatial` then you can continue the rest of the install without using `sudo`.

The runtime directory can be configured by setting the `RUNTIME` env var at BOTH install time AND at runtime if you can't write to `/opt` for any reason.

## Local Runtime Environment

### Generic installation (works on Mac/Linux)

```bash
export RUNTIME='/opt/spatial'
sudo mkdir -p $RUNTIME
sudo chown $USER $RUNTIME

cd runtime/install
./_all.sh
```

The install will take 5-10 minutes depending on your hardware.
A complete runtime environment consumes about 50Mb of disk space.

```bash
du -sh /opt/spatial
 49M	/opt/spatial
```
